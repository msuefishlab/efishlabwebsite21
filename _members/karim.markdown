Karim Larbi is an international student from Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany.  He did his Bachelor's Thesis (implementing an optogenetic system into the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis) back in Germany and now I am absolving my senior year as an exchange student here at MSU in the course of the Bachelor Biology International program of his university.
