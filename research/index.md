Our work is fundamentally integrative and spans biological levels of analysis and disciplines, including ecology and evolution, genomics and bioinformatics, physiology, developmental biology, and animal behavior. Our work takes place in the field, the laboratory and in silico. Our laboratory focuses on (1) building weakly electric fish as a model for genotype-to-phenotype studies, (2) the evolution and development of electric organs (3) the proximate and ultimate causes of electric signal evolution and (4) the evolution of electric fish reproduction.
